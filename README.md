# 🔥 Forest Fire Prediction System

## 📌 Overview
The **Forest Fire Prediction System** is a machine learning-based project that predicts the risk of a forest fire based on environmental conditions such as temperature, wind speed, humidity, and rainfall. The system uses **Gradient Boosting Regressor** to make predictions and classify the fire risk as **"Forest is Safe!"** or **"Forest is in Danger!"**.

---

## 🚀 Features
- Takes **temperature, wind speed, humidity, and rain levels** as input.
- Predicts **forest fire risk** using machine learning.
- Uses **Gradient Boosting Regressor** for better accuracy.
- Provides a **clear alert message** based on predictions.
- Integrated **email alert system** to notify users in case of high fire risk.

## 🛠 Installation

### 1️⃣ Clone the Repository
```bash
git clone https://github.com/your-username/Forest-Fire-Prediction-System.git
cd Forest-Fire-Prediction-System
```

### 2️⃣ Install Dependencies
Ensure you have **Python 3.8+** installed, then run:
```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

### 3️⃣ Run the Application
```bash
python app.py
```

---

## 🔍 Usage
1. Run the script and enter values for **temperature, wind speed, humidity, and rain**.
2. The system will predict whether the forest is **safe** or **in danger**.
3. If the fire risk is high, an **email alert** will be sent automatically.
