# Forest_Fire_Prediction_System
The Forest Fire Prediction System is a machine learning-based application that predicts the risk of forest fires based on environmental factors such as temperature, wind speed, humidity, and rainfall. It utilizes a Gradient Boosting Regressor model to analyze fire risk and classify the forest status as "Safe" or "In Danger!".
